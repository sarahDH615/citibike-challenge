## Citibike Analysis

### Are there differences between numbers of male and female users over 2018-present? What does that say about the success of outreach?

By year, the percentage of female users have grown over the time period, suggesting outreach to women has been somewhat successful. However, the amount of growth is small. Furthermore, users seem to have grown more reticent about identifying their gender. Another gender identification system, and greater outreach to women is recommended. 

Usage by women is concentrated in a few stations. These stations may be places for starting increased outreach and further research into why these stations are more popular. A younger median female age is one factor this analysis has identified as potentially relating to greater amounts of female users. 

### Which bikes are likely to need servicing?

Twenty bikes were identified as potentially needing servicing, due to their higher amount of trips, or higher average or total duration of trips. 

### What patterns can be found in the most popular start and end stations?

The start stations' popularities are more densely packed near the New Jersey side of the Hudson River, while the end station popularities are more diffuse, with a few popular end stations, also on the New Jersey side of the Hudson, with very many stations with low popularity spread throughout Manhattan. This suggests the pattern of people commuting in from a central New Jersey area, spreading to various points throughout Manhattan for employment, and returning home to the central New Jersey area. 

Both start and end stations with high popularity tend to be located in areas with incomes of $37,200 - $461,000 (the highest bracket in the survey), suggesting that it is people with a good deal of disposable income who use Citibike. Advertising that emphasises affordability and value could potentially increase usage by people with lower incomes/living in lower income areas.
